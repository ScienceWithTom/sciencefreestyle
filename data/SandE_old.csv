S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Design,an iterative process that allows you to come up with solutions to problems,"refine, remind, combie, feline, allign, ",2,2,Middle School,6
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Engineer,"a person who designs, builds, or maintains solutions to real world problems","atmosphere, chandalier, hemisphere, perservere,  ",3,3,Middle School,6
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Iterate,"to test the most promising result, modify your design, and do it again!","calculate, cooperate, delegate, fabricate, graduate, heavyweight, accelerate, generate",3,3,Middle School,6
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Model,"a way to communicate and test design ideas - whether sketches, drawings, or physical","dawdle, oughta, aristotle, boondoggle, wobble, bottle",2,2,Middle School,6
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Impact,"the social, cultural, and environmental consequences of a given design may be constraints on the design","react, in tact, in fact, abstract, contract, adapt, unpack",2,2
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Limitation,a specific material or resource that may constraint your design,"litigation, precipitation, complication, constellation, education, mitigation",3,4
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Data,the measurable variables that allow scientists to get results and allow engineers to test designs,"beta, theta, fatal, Vegas, later, rated, greater",2,2
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Systematic,"following characteristic steps. In the case of engineering design, these include identifying problems and testing solutions","automatic, acrobatic, schematic, ecstatic",3,4

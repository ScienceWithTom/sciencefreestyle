S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Constraint,limit of available materials and resources that influence your design solution to a given problem,"complaint, insane, contain",2,2,Middle School,6
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Criteria,the desired features of solution,"quite serious, cnidaria, hilarious,",3,4,Middle School,6
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Design,an iterative process that allows you to come up with solutions to problems,"refine, remind, combine",2,2,Middle School,6
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Engineer,"a person who designs, builds, or maintains solutions to real world problems","perservere, atmosphere, chandalier,",3,3,Middle School,6
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Iterate,"to test the most promising result, modify your design, and do it again!","fabricate, calculate, cooperate",3,3,Middle School,6
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Model,"a way to communicate and test design ideas - whether sketches, drawings, or physical","dawdle, oughta, aristotle,",2,2,Middle School,6
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Impact,"the social, cultural, and environmental consequences of a given design may be constraints on the design","adapt, react, intact",2,2,,
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Limitation,a specific material or resource that may constraint your design,"litigation, precipitation, complication,",3,4,,
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Data,the measurable variables that allow scientists to get results and allow engineers to test designs,"theta, fatal, Vegas",2,2,,
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Systematic,"following characteristic steps. In the case of engineering design, these include identifying problems and testing solutions","it's ecstatic, automatic, a schematic",3,4,,
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Modify,"During the iterative cycle, an engineer will change (modify) a design based on how a prototype performs","codify, multiply, quantify",3,3,Middle School,6
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Optimal,"the best or most favorable solution, which will depend on the design criteria (cost, performance, etc.)","drop the ball, possible, obstacle",3,3,Middle School,6
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Precise,"exact - measurements, protocols, and words must be precise for engineering and science to proceed","advice, despite, revise",2,2,Middle School,6
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Refine,improve by making small changes,"define, remind, feline",2,2,Middle School,6
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Solution,one possible way to solve a design problem. engineers generally brainstorm many solutions and then test and iterate on the best ones,"conclusion, illusion, evolution",3,3,Middle School,6
S&E PRACTICES,Engineering,Problem,a need or desire that can be solved by engineering design. Identifying this need or problem is an important part of the design process,"solve 'em, quantum, bottom, common",2,,,

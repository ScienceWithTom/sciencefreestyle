# GitHub Jargon Notes
*push --> sending your new files to the GitHub
*Git is the technology that allows you to do versioning. GitHub is platrom.
*pull --> pulling information from GitHub. there is what on your comp and what is GitHub
*important to commit often in small chunks because it only saves changes. If you do something wrong, easy to invert that change.
